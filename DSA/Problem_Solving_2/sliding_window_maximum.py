Problem Description

Given an array of integers A. There is a sliding window of size B which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the B numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves rightwards by one position. You have to find the maximum for each window.

Return an array C, where C[i] is the maximum value in the array from A[i] to A[i+B-1].

Refer to the given example for clarity.

NOTE: If B > length of the array, return 1 element with the max of the array.



Problem Constraints

1 <= |A|, B <= 106



Input Format

The first argument given is the integer array A.

The second argument given is the integer B.



Output Format

Return an array C, where C[i] is the maximum value of from A[i] to A[i+B-1].



Example Input

Input 1:

 A = [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7]
 B = 3
Input 2:

 A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 7, 1, 3, 6]
 B = 6


Example Output

Output 1:

 [3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7]
Output 2:

 [7, 7, 7, 7]


Example Explanation

Explanation 1:

 Window position     | Max
 --------------------|-------
 [1 3 -1] -3 5 3 6 7 | 3
 1 [3 -1 -3] 5 3 6 7 | 3
 1 3 [-1 -3 5] 3 6 7 | 5
 1 3 -1 [-3 5 3] 6 7 | 5
 1 3 -1 -3 [5 3 6] 7 | 6
 1 3 -1 -3 5 [3 6 7] | 7
Explanation 2:

 Window position     | Max
 --------------------|-------
 [1 2 3 4 2 7] 1 3 6 | 7
 1 [2 3 4 2 7 1] 3 6 | 7
 1 2 [3 4 2 7 1 3] 6 | 7
 1 2 3 [4 2 7 1 3 6] | 7'''
